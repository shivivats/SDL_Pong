# Pong

## A very basic pong clone written in C++ using SDL

Huge props to this tutorial, I followed it pretty much to a T.

The most notable change I made was separating everything into its own class.

I also renamed a few things to more appropriate terms (imo) and added some null pointer and error checking.

I also made a small gameplay functionality change in making the ball go straight upon respawning instead of going at an angle.

Todo (taken from the tutorial):
[] Adding sprites for more interesting graphics
[] Adding particle effects (like a ball trail)
[] Adding a start menu
[] Adding a delay after scoring and ball respawning
[] Adding more interesting physics to the bounces to make them less predictable
